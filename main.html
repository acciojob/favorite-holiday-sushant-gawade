        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Kyoto, once the imperial capital of Japan for over a thousand years, is renowned for its classical Buddhist temples,
            traditional wooden <i>machiya</i> houses, peaceful Zen gardens, and historic geisha districts. It perfectly blends ancient history
            with modern life, offering a truly unique and <b>profound cultural experience</b>. Unlike Tokyo, Kyoto retained much of its
            pre-war heritage and remains the spiritual and cultural heart of the nation.
